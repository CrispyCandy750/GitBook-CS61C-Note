## main function

To get the `main` function to accept arguments, use this:

- `int main (int argc, char *argv[])`

- `argc` will contain the number of strings on the command line (the executable counts as one, plus one for each argument). Here `argc` is 2:
    - `unix% sort myFile`
- `argv` is a pointer to an array containing the arguments as strings (more on pointers later).
