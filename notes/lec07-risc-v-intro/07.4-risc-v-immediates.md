## Immediates

Immediates are numerical constants

They appear often in code, so there are special instructions for them.

Add Immediate:

```c
addi x3,x4,10 // (in RISC-V)
f = g + 10 //(in C)
```

- where RISC-V registers x3,x4 are associated with C variables f, g 

Syntax similar to add instruction, except that last argument is a number instead of a register.

There is no Subtract Immediate in RISC-V: Why?

- There are add and sub, but no addi counterpart

Limit types of operations that can be done to absolute minimum

- if an operation can be decomposed into a simpler operation, don’t include it
- addi …, -x = “subi …, x” => so no “subi”

```c
addi x3,x4,-10 // (in RISC-V)
f = g - 10 // (in C)
```

- where RISC-V registers x3,x4 are associated with C variables f, g, respectively

## Register Zero

One particular immediate, the number zero (0), appears very often in code.

So the register zero (x0) is ‘hard-wired’ to value 0; e.g

```c
add x3,x4,x0 // (in RISC-V)
f = g // (in C)
```

where RISC-V registers x3,x4 are associated with C variables f, g

Defined in hardware, so an instruction 

```assembly
add x0,x3,x4
```

will not do anything!
