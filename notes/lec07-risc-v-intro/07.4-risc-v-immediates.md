## Immediates

Immediates are numerical constants

> 就是汇编语言中的常数，可以译为立即数

They appear often in code, so there are special instructions for them.

Add Immediate: in RISC-V

```Assembly
addi x3,x4,10
```

> addi的意思就是add immediate

in C

```c
f = g + 10
```

* where RISC-V registers x3,x4 are associated with C variables f, g

Syntax similar to add instruction, except that last argument is a number instead of a register.

<mark style="background-color:green;">**There is no Subtract Immediate in RISC-V**</mark>: Why?

* There are add and sub, but no addi counterpart

Limit types of operations that can be done to absolute minimum

* if an operation can be decomposed into a simpler operation, don’t include it
* addi …, -x = "subi …, x" => so no "subi"

in RISC-V

```assembly
addi x3,x4,-10
```

in C

```c
f = g - 10
```

* where RISC-V registers x3,x4 are associated with C variables f, g, respectively

## Register Zero

One particular immediate, the number zero (0), appears very often in code.

So the register zero (x0) is 'hard-wired' to value 0; e.g

in RISC-V

```assembly
add x3,x4,x0
```

in C

```c
f = g
```

where RISC-V registers x3,x4 are associated with C variables f, g

> 这个操作可以理解为赋值操作啊，简单，复用了指令

Defined in hardware, so an instruction

```assembly
add x0,x3,x4
```

will **not do anything!**
