## Great Idea #1: Abstraction (Levels of Representation/Interpretation)

## Assembly Language

Basic job of a CPU: **execute lots of instructions**.

Instructions are the primitive operations that the CPU may execute

- Like a sentence: operations (verbs) applied to operands (objects) processed in sequence …

Different CPUs implement different sets of instructions. The set of instructions a particular CPU implements is an Instruction Set Architecture (ISA)

- Examples: ARM (cell phones), Intel x86 (i9, i7, i5, i3), IBM Power, IBM/Motorola PowerPC (old Macs), MIPS, RISC-V, ...

## Book: Programming From the Ground Up

> “A new book was just released which is based on a new concept - teaching computer science through assembly language (Linux x86 assembly language, to be exact). This book teaches how the machine itself operates, rather than just the language. I've found that the key difference between mediocre and excellent programmers is whether or not they know assembly language. Those that do tend to understand computers themselves at a much deeper level. Although [almost!] unheard of today, this concept isn't really all that new -- there used to not be much choice in years past. Apple computers came with only BASIC and assembly language, and there were books available on assembly language for kids. This is why the old-timers are often viewed as 'wizards': they had to know assembly language programming.”  —— slashdot.org comment, 2004-02-05



## Instruction Set Architectures

Early trend was to add more and more instructions to new CPUs to do elaborate operations

- VAX architecture had an instruction to multiply polynomials!

RISC philosophy (Cocke IBM, Patterson, Hennessy, 1980s) – Reduced Instruction Set Computing

- Keep the instruction set small and simple, makes it easier to build fast hardware.
- Let software do complicated operations by composing simpler ones
- This went against the convention wisdom of the time. (he who laughs last, laughs best) 

## RISC-V Architecture

New open-source, license-free ISA spec

-  Supported by growing shared software ecosystem
-  Appropriate for all levels of computing system, from microcontrollers to supercomputers
- 32-bit, 64-bit, and 128-bit variants (we’re using 32-bit in class, textbook uses 64-bit)

Why RISC-V instead of Intel 80x86?

- RISC-V is simple, elegant. Don’t want to get bogged down in gritty details.
- RISC-V has exponential adoption

## RISC-V Origins

Started in Summer 2010 to support open research and teaching at UC Berkeley

- Lineage can be traced to RISC-I/II projects (1980s) 

As the project matured, it migrated to RISC-V foundation (www.riscv.org )

Many commercial and research projects based on RISC-V, open-source and proprietary

- Widely used in education
